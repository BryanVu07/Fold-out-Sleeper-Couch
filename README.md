# README - MIE301 Design Project: Fold-Out Sleeper Couch

Project Overview:
Welcome to my design project for the *Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines* course, MIE301, Fall 2024. This project focuses on the redesign and improvement of a **fold-out sleeper couch mechanism** to meet client requirements and address potential issues. The goal is to perform a thorough kinematic analysis of the existing mechanism and propose a solution to enhance its function, in line with course topics such as linkages, cams, gears, and other mechanical systems.

Course Objectives:

Upon completing this project, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of the following core objectives from the course:
- Identify and classify kinematic mechanisms: I will recognize the different components within the fold-out couch mechanism and categorize them, identifying their role in the machine's overall operation.
- Analyze motion of mechanical systems: Using both graphical and analytical techniques, I will examine the motion of linkages and any other relevant mechanisms within the couch, evaluating their performance and limitations.
- Use computer software for analysis: I will apply MATLAB and other relevant tools to simulate the motion of the couch’s mechanism, comparing the original design with my proposed modification.
- Contribute to an engineering design team: In this project, I’m assuming the role of an engineer, presenting solutions to a client and responding to their feedback through an upgrade proposal.
- Apply engineering tools to solve real problems: I will showcase how theoretical knowledge is applied in practical design, improving a real-world mechanism based on client needs.
- Effectively communicate complex mechanisms: Through reports and presentations, I will articulate the functionality of the redesign to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Project Details:

Product: Fold-Out Sleeper Couch

This project focuses on redesigning the fold-out sleeper couch mechanism. The machine contains multiple kinematic linkages that allow the couch to transition between seating and sleeping configurations. There is potential to improve this design, perhaps in the smoothness of the motion, ease of use, or durability.

Client: Prof. H.

Prof. H, acting as the client, has requested a modification to address certain complaints or suggested improvements to the sleeper couch’s folding mechanism. My team and I will work on addressing these concerns by providing a technical redesign and proving its effectiveness through kinematic analysis.

Manager: Project T.

In this project, the Project TA acts as the non-technical project manager who will assess and guide our proposal from a managerial perspective. We will ensure that our reports are accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Project Milestones:

1. Pitch Meeting
I will start by pitching the design change in a 3-minute meeting with my engineering manager. This will involve a brief explanation of the current mechanism, the client's request, and my proposed change. Based on the feedback from this meeting, I will move forward with the next steps in the project.

2. Project Proposal Report
In this phase, I will detail the existing fold-out mechanism, the client’s issue, and the proposed design changes. The proposal will also outline the analysis techniques to demonstrate the effectiveness of the redesign. A kinematic model of both the original and redesigned mechanisms will be presented to show how the design solves the problem while maintaining the product’s essential functions.

3. Final Report
The final report will provide a comprehensive analysis of the original and redesigned mechanisms. Using techniques learned in MIE301, such as graphical and analytical methods, I will prove that the modified mechanism meets the client’s needs. The report will also include MATLAB simulations, CAD models, and other relevant visuals to support the analysis. The audience for this report includes both technical engineers and non-technical managers.

Expected Outcomes:
The redesigned fold-out sleeper couch mechanism should address the client’s complaint, offering a smoother, more reliable transition between positions. The analysis will demonstrate how the changes improve the overall function of the mechanism, backed by a full kinematic review.

Tools and Techniques:
- Graphical and Analytical Methods: Position, velocity, and acceleration analysis of linkages.
- MATLAB: Custom code for simulating kinematic and dynamic behavior of the mechanism.
- CAD Models: Visual representation of both the original and modified mechanisms.

Submission:

- Team Composition and Topic: Early in the term, I’ll submit details about the team and the project topic, including a description of the fold-out sleeper couch and its kinematic complexity.
- Project Proposal and Final Report: Reports will focus on technical accuracy, complexity, and effective communication of the engineering solution.

Conclusion:

This project showcases my ability to apply kinematic and dynamic analysis techniques learned in MIE301 to a real-world problem. Through redesigning the fold-out sleeper couch mechanism, I will demonstrate both technical expertise and the ability to communicate engineering concepts effectively.
